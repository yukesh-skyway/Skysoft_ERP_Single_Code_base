# Changelog

All notable changes to shadcn-scheduler will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2025-03-19

### Added

- **Row mode setting**: `rowMode: "category" | "individual"` in `Settings`. Category mode (default) stacks all shifts per department row — scales to 200+ staff. Individual mode shows one row per employee under a collapsible category header. Toggle in the Settings gear panel.
- **Right-click context menu** on shift blocks: Edit, Copy, Cut (removes from grid immediately, paste with Ctrl+V), Delete. Powered by `@radix-ui/react-context-menu`.
- **Hover popover** on shift blocks: shows employee name, category, time range, duration, break info, conflict warning. Fixed-position portal — escapes all clipping contexts.
- **2D free drag**: dragged block now physically follows the cursor across the entire grid (any row, any time, any day). Real block element moves via DOM mutation — no separate ghost copy.
- **Vertical edge-scroll**: dragging near the top or bottom of the grid now scrolls vertically. Combined with horizontal edge-scroll (week/multiday). Both axes use RAF loop with proximity-scaled acceleration.
- **4px desktop drag threshold**: mouse must move ≥4px before drag mode commits, preventing accidental block moves on click. Touch devices retain the 500ms long-press gate.
- **Cross-day drag in single-day view**: dragging a block past the right edge moves it to the next day; past the left edge moves it to the previous day.
- **Break support**: `breakStartH` and `breakEndH` added to `Block` type. Add/edit break in shift modals with duration slider (15m–2h) or exact start/end times. Break gap visualised as a dark notch on the block.
- **Smart popover positioning**: hover popover flips from above to below when the block is within 140px of the viewport top.
- **Sidebar improvements**: resizable drag handle, sortable column headers (Name/Hours/Shifts), `Manager · 8.0h · 4 shifts` format, capacity bar per category.
- `RowMode` type exported from index.ts.

### Changed

- **Drag performance**: `grabOffsetX`, `grabOffsetY`, `gridRect` captured once at pointerdown — eliminates 3× `getBoundingClientRect` reflows per pointermove frame (was 180/sec at 60fps).
- **Edge scroll**: replaced synchronous `scrollLeft ±= 12` with RAF loop; speed scales 0.1×–1.0× by proximity to edge.
- **Block content**: name on line 1, time range on line 2 (stacked). `ew-resize` cursor on handles.
- **Resize handles**: always visible, `var(--primary)` background, `var(--primary-foreground)` dots.
- **ShiftModal**: date picker popover replaces inline Calendar; category field moved above time; cleaner header with name, category, status badge.

### Fixed

- Collapsed category drop guard: dropping on a collapsed category now cancels cleanly instead of committing the block to an invisible row.
- `contain: "layout style paint"` removed from block elements — `paint` keyword was silently clipping the hover popover.
- List view day mode showing "No Shifts": `end` date was set to midnight; now set to 23:59:59 so same-day shifts (parsed as T12:00) are included.
- 33 broken CSS variables: `var(--border))`, `var(--muted))` etc. (extra closing paren) fixed across GridView, StaffPanel, RoleWarningModal, BottomSheet, MonthView, YearView.
- Literal `\n` text node rendering in sidebar category header.
- Cut shift now correctly copies to buffer and removes from grid (previously opened delete confirm instead of removing immediately).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Performance — Windowed data**: Day and week views now pre-filter shifts to only the visible date window before passing to GridView. With a 21-day buffer, ~6,000 shifts enter the grid instead of 104,000 for a full year — ~17× reduction.
- **Performance — Shift index**: GridView builds a `Map<categoryId:dateISO, Block[]>` for O(1) lookups instead of scanning all shifts per cell. Per-cell cost drops from 104,000 iterations to a single `Map.get()`.
- **Performance — Memoized displayShifts**: `displayShifts` is now memoized so it no longer invalidates `categoryHeights` and downstream useMemos on every render.
- **Performance — DOM ghost during drag**: The drag preview ghost is updated via direct DOM manipulation instead of React state. Pointer move no longer triggers React re-renders; only drag start and drag end do. Combined with the above, drag stays smooth even with large datasets.
- **Performance — CSS containment & GPU hints**: Grid container uses `contain: layout style` and `willChange: contents` during drag. Blocks use `contain: layout style paint` and `willChange: transform` when dragging. `scheduler-tokens.css` adds global rules for `[data-scheduler-block]` and `[data-scheduler-ghost]` for isolated rendering islands.

### Changed

- **Hour grid borders**: Day and week view hour separators now use `--sch-b-12` for consistent, subtle borders.
- **Demo data**: Demo page uses lighter test data (20 staff, 5 categories, 7 days) for faster load.

### Fixed

- Demo page now anchors to the current week on load and uses correct date range.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Zoom-based time intervals (day view)**: When zoomed in (zoom ≥ 1.25), day view shows **30-minute** time labels (7:00, 7:30, 8:00…) and grid lines; at default zoom, hourly labels (7am, 8am…) are shown. Shifts can be placed and snapped at 30-minute increments.
- **Zoom-based time labels (week view)**: Week view time label gap now depends on zoom: **1-hour** when zoomed in (zoom ≥ 1.25), **2-hour** at default (0.8 ≤ zoom < 1.25), **4-hour** when zoomed out (zoom < 0.8) so labels fit in narrow columns (~117px).
- **Drag shifts between days**: In day and week view, you can drag an existing shift to a different day. When moving across days, the shift keeps its start/end time (no accidental resize).
- **Week view scroll sync**: The calendar header range updates as you scroll horizontally in week view to reflect the visible week. Scrolling near the left or right edge loads the previous or next week (buffer) and preserves scroll position.
- **Month view “+X more”**: On dates with overflow shifts, hovering “+X more” shows a popover with the list of overflow shifts; clicking opens a dialog with all shifts for that day, grouped by category with times.
- **Year view scheduled dates**: Days that have shifts now use a clearer highlight (primary color) so scheduled dates are easier to see.
- **Double-click navigation**: Double-click a date in month view to open that week in week view; double-click a date in week view to open that day in day view.
- **Prefetching / data loading API**: New props `bufferDays` (default 15), `onVisibleRangeChange`, and `prefetchThreshold` (default 0.8) for loading data as the user scrolls. Day and week views render a configurable buffer of days/weeks; the callback fires when the user scrolls near the edge so the host can fetch from an API and optionally trim old data.
- **Week view date headers**: Day headers in week view now include the month name (e.g. “Mar Tue 17”) for context.

### Changed

- **“Now” indicator**: The red “now” line in day/week view is now a muted, less distracting color so it doesn’t dominate the grid.
- **Week view header date**: Header shows the visible week (display date) while scrolling without rebuilding the full buffer, so scrolling stays smooth and prev/next week at the edges works correctly.

### Fixed

- Week view: Header date range now updates correctly when scrolling horizontally (no more jump-back or wrong range).
- Day view: Dragging a shift to another day no longer changes its duration (resize was incorrectly applied on cross-day move).

## [0.2.0] - 2025-03-13

### Added

- **Day view with infinite horizontal scroll**: Day view now shows 31 days in a continuous horizontal timeline. Each day displays its visible hours (e.g., 7am–5pm) with hour labels (7am, 8am, 9am, etc.) in each day column header. Scroll left/right to navigate through dates.
- **Day view date sync**: The calendar date navigator updates as you scroll in day view, and clicking a date in the calendar (or using prev/next) scrolls the day view to that date.
- **Week view time labels**: Hour labels (7am, 9am, 11am, etc.) now appear below each date in week view, with 2-hour intervals. Configurable via `WEEK_TIME_LABEL_GAP` in constants.
- **Week view wider columns**: Day columns in week view are now larger for better readability.
- **Add-shift (+) button placement**: The + button to add shifts is now fixed at the bottom of each category cell, always visible, and no longer overlapped by shift blocks.
- **Settings gear in header**: The settings gear icon is now in the header next to the action buttons instead of the footer.

### Changed

- **Badge variant (shift interaction mode)**: Replaced options (Dot, Background, Both) with:
  - **Drag & drop**: Only drag shifts; no resize handles
  - **Resizable**: Only resize shifts; no drag
  - **Both**: Drag and resize (default)
- **Visible hours in day view**: Day view now only shows the visible hour range (e.g., 7am–5pm). Hours outside the range (e.g., 9am or 6pm) are no longer displayed when the range is 10am–5pm.
- **Removed dot badge style**: The dot-only visual style has been removed. Shifts always use the default background gradient.
- **footerSlot location**: The `footerSlot` prop now renders in the header area (before header actions) rather than the footer. The prop name is kept for backward compatibility.

### Fixed

- Day view now correctly syncs with the date navigator when scrolling horizontally.
- Calendar date picker now scrolls day view to the selected date.
